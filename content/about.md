## Who I Am

I'm a passionate music educator with 14 years of experience teaching elementary and middle school students in New Jersey public schools. I also teach extracurricular STEM and Maker courses.  My mother was a classically trained musician and a programmer, and she always told me that programming and music were linked. It took me many years to understand, but the magic of this connection is not an accident. Both are essentially about learning to sequence free parameters in orderly ways.

Three years ago, I learned to 3D print. Our school had purchased printers back in 2017, and they sat completely unused until 2022.  By then, they were already obsolete!  Although I only had some CAD experience from high school, It only took 30 minutes of training to get me hooked. What started as personal curiosity quickly became something more when teachers kept asking me, "How can I do this too?" That's why I created Djangobee Prints.

## My Mission

I believe we're living through a time of educational upheaval. Many ideas circulating from teacher colleges need closer investigation, and traditional methods of teaching need reinforcement, not replacement.

My mission is to empower elementary educators to become makers - to use technology that enhances rather than replaces effective teaching methods. I want to help teachers create tools that serve their students without simply adding more screen time or trying to turn children into "21st century" widgets.

Technology has incredible power when used thoughtfully. My goal is to share the technical know-how that helps educators design their own solutions for their own classrooms, rather than relying on one-size-fits-all programs that may not serve our students well.
