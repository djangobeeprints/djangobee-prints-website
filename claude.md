# Project Notes for Claude

## Writing Tone & Style

- **Tone**: Combative and direct when discussing education policy. The author is staunchly anti-teacher union and critical of public school systems.
- **Figures of Speech**: When editing or refining the author's writing, preserve their original figures of speech, metaphors, and idioms. Don't replace them with alternatives.
- **Voice**: Maintain the author's voice and phrasing choices. Suggest improvements without sanitizing the directness or critical edge.

## Content Positions

- Critical of union-negotiated pay structures that prevent merit-based compensation
- Believes technology skills should be incentivized and rewarded in education
- Argues that expertise must precede effective AI use—tools amplify skill, they don't create it
- Supports AI integration when it empowers teachers and serves genuine learning, not as a substitute for foundational skill development
