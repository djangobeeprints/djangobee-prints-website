                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Djangobee Prints is dedicated to helping elementary educators integrate technology
                    meaningfully into their classrooms. Our mission is to empower teachers with practical
                    tools, resources, and insights that enhance learning while maintaining the human
                    connection at the heart of education.

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    We are passionate educators who believe that technology should serve learning, not
                    the other way around. With years of experience in elementary education and a deep
                    understanding of child development, we bridge the gap between innovative technology
                    and age-appropriate pedagogy.
                </p>

                <h2>What We Believe</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Technology should enhance, not replace, traditional hands-on learning</li>
                    <li>Digital literacy is an essential skill that should be taught from early grades</li>
                    <li>The best tech integration is invisible - it supports learning goals seamlessly</li>
                    <li>Teachers need practical, classroom-tested resources, not theoretical frameworks</li>
                    <li>Every child deserves access to quality technology education</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    We envision elementary classrooms where technology serves as a natural extension of
                    learning - where students develop digital literacy alongside traditional skills, where
                    teachers feel confident and supported in their tech integration, and where the joy of
                    discovery and creativity remains at the center of education.
